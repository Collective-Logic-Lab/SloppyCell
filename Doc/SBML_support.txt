SloppyCell SBML Support
=======================

Support for the following features of SBML is planned for SloppyCell
version 0.3:

- Algebraic rules
- Mathematical expressions using piecewise
- Logical operators in event triggers

Others features not currently supported:

- Delay terms in mathematical expressions
- Unit manipulations

We are interested in adding support for those features that folks are using.
Please contact us if we're missing a feature you would find useful.
