Installing SloppyCell
=====================

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required to run
+++++++++++++++
* Python_
* SciPy_
* matplotlib_

Required to build
+++++++++++++++++
* Fortran77 compiler

Recommended
+++++++++++
* LibSBML_: Required for SBML import and export. Be sure to build ``--with-python``.
* IPython_: A dramatic improvement over the standard python shell.
* Graphviz_: SloppyCell can generate ``.dot`` files specifying network diagrams,which can be visualized using Graphviz. 
* Psyco_: A just-in-time compiler for python, Psyco will speed up integrations by about 50% on supported platforms.


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. topic:: On Windows

   1. Install required dependencies.
      Enthought provides `a distribution <http://code.enthought.com/enthon/>`_ of Python that includes NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Unfortunately, it is a little out of date.

      Alternatively, Python and all three packages each have nice installers of their own. We suggest using Python 2.4, as it is only version for which there are pre-built libsbml libraries.
      
   2. `Download <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=140498>`_ and run the executable installer. If using the Enthought distribution, you'll want the ``-enthon1.00`` version. Otherwise, you'll want the ``py2.4`` version.

   3. To access libsbml from python, you'll need to `setup your PYTHONPATH and
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH <http://sysbio.molgen.mpg.de/sbmlmerge/sbmlmerge_manual/node36.html>`_.

   4. If you'd like to build SloppyCell yourself, I suggest following the
      directions to install MinGW as described
      `here <http://scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Windows>`_. Then you should be
      able to do a ``python setup.py build -cmingw32 bdist_wininst`` to build
      your own installer.

.. topic:: On OS X and Linux

   1. Install required dependencies.  
      A pre-built version of g77 (Fortran77 compiler) for OSX is available at http://hpc.sf.net.
   2. Unpack the tarball. (``tar xzf SloppyCell-???.tar.gz``)
   3. Descend into the SloppyCell-??? directory. (``cd SloppyCell-???``)
   4. Run the installation script. (``python setup.py install``) 
   5. Run the included test routines. (``cd Testing; python test.py``)
