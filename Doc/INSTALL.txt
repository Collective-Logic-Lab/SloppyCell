Installing SloppyCell
=====================

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required to run
+++++++++++++++
* Python_
* Scipy_
* matplotlib_

Required to build
+++++++++++++++++
* Fortran77 compiler

Recommended
+++++++++++
* IPython_: A dramatic improvement over the standard python shell.
* LibSBML_: Required for SBML import and export. Be sure to build ``--with-python``.
* Psyco_: A just-in-time compiler for python, Psyco will speed up integrations by about 50% on supported platforms.
* Graphviz_: SloppyCell can generate ``.dot`` files specifying network diagrams,which can be visualized using Graphviz. 


Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. topic:: On Windows

   1. Install required dependencies. The binary of SloppyCell below requires
      python2.4 and at least numpy 1.0rc1 and scipy 0.5.1.
      
      Enthought (as of 9/21/06) provides a python distribution including numpy,
      scipy, and matplotlib, but on my machine the numpy appeared to be broken.

   2. Download and run the `executable installer <SloppyCell-CVS.win32-py2.4.exe>`_ (built 9/21/06).

   3. To access libsbml from python, you'll need to `setup your PYTHONPATH and
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH <http://sysbio.molgen.mpg.de/sbmlmerge/sbmlmerge_manual/node36.html>`_.

   4. If you'd like to build SloppyCell yourself, I suggest following the
      directions to install MinGW as described
      `here <http://scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Windows>`_. Then you should be
      able to do a ``python setup.py build -cmingw32 bdist_wininst`` to build
      your own installer.

.. topic:: On OS X and Linux

   1. Install required dependencies.  
      (On OS X 10.3, we recommend installing 
      `MacEnthon <http://download.enthought.com/MacEnthon/>`_ which will install
      Scipy, matplotlib, and IPython. A pre-built version of g77 (Fortran77 
      compiler) for OSX 10.3 is available at http://hpc.sf.net.)
   2. Unpack the tarball. (``tar xzf SloppyCell-0.3.tar.gz``)
   3. Descend into the SloppyCell-0.3 directory. (``cd SloppyCell-0.3``)
   4. Run the installation script. (``python setup.py install``) 
   5. Run the included test routines. (``cd Testing; python test.py``)
