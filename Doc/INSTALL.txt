Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. topic:: On Windows

   1. Install required dependencies.
      Python, NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib all have nice windows installers. We
      suggest using Python 2.4.x, as prebuilt libsbml 2.3.4 binaries are
      unavailable for other versions of Python.
      
   2. `Download <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=140498>`_ and run the executable installer.

   3. To access libsbml from python, you'll need to `setup your PYTHONPATH and
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH <http://sysbio.molgen.mpg.de/sbmlmerge/sbmlmerge_manual/node36.html>`_. All these instructions are performed using the Control Panel.

   4. If you'd like to build SloppyCell yourself or take advantage of the C
      speed-ups, I suggest installing ``MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>``_.
      To do so, `download <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435>`_ and run ``MinGW-?.?.?.exe``. (? refers to the version number. I've had success with version 5.1.3.)
      Tell the installer to setup g++ and g77, in addition to the normal C compiler.

      Unfortunately, there is a slight problem with MinGW. To fix it, follow `these instructions <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=000b01c52777%241d7d7580%24d86d65da%40DANNY>`_. On my system, ``libgcc.a`` was in ``c:\mingw\lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2``.

.. topic:: On OS X and Linux

   1. Install required dependencies.  
      A pre-built version of g77 (Fortran77 compiler) for OSX is available at http://hpc.sf.net.
   2. Unpack the tarball. (``tar xzf SloppyCell-???.tar.gz``)
   3. Descend into the SloppyCell-??? directory. (``cd SloppyCell-???``)
   4. Run the installation script. (``python setup.py install``) 
      This may fail due to difficulties with fortran compilation. More information on the available fortran compilers can be found with ``python setup.py config_fc --help_fcompiler``
   5. Run the included test routines. (``cd Testing; python test.py``)
