Introduction to SloppyCell
==========================

SloppyCell revolves around two main types of objects, Networks and 
Models. A Network object describes a set of interacting chemical species and any
experimental procedure they are subject to. A Model unites one or more Networks
with a set of experimental data.

To get access to the suite of SloppyCell tools, each Python script in a 
SloppyCell project begins with: ::

  from SloppyCell.ReactionNetworks import *


The first step in any project is building the relevant Network(s). To learn
more about their construction, please see the `Building Networks Tutorial`_
