6/03/05: rng7: 
    Renamed Analysis.py to PerfectData.py to better reflect its purpose
5/18/05: rng7: SBMLInterface.py
    Added support for going from SBML files to dot files for GraphViz
5/11/05: rng7: SBMLInterface.py
    SBML export added. Need to define annotations for optimizability, etc.
5/11/05: rng7: Parsing.py Network.py
    Clean up of function subsitution code to handle f(x)**y case.
4/29/05: rng7: Parsing.py
    Cleanup of variable and function extracting code. Was recursing too far.
    Result is a pretty major speedup in reaction construction.
4/28/05: rng7: symbolic.py Network.py
    Major cleanup of differentiation code. Now saving results for faster reuse.
    Also moved outputted files into SloppyModels.TEMP_DIR
4/26/05: rng7: Integration.py
    Added preliminary support for integrating in terms of log(concentration)
4/15/05: rng7: Network.py
    Added FindFixedPoint
4/15/04: rng7: Network.py (Trajectory)
    Allowing trajectories to be appended
4/15/04: rng7: Network.py (Trajectory)
    Allowing trajectories to be appended
3/31/05: rng7: Network.py, Integration.py
    Added support for typicalValues of variables. In integration, we now can
    specify rtol and, if rtol is not None, atol = rtol * [typicalValues].
    Things we probably want to support that aren't in there now:
     Specifying atol
     Specifying rtol on a species by species basis (should this be input as a
      dictionary or KeyedList?)
3/31/05: rng7: Network.py (Trajectory)
    General cleanup. Changed '__' notation to '__derivWRT__' which should be
    more robust.
3/30/05: rng7: Analysis.py
    Improved numerical precision in calculation of perfect data LM hessians.
3/29/05: rng7: Network.py (TexForm)
    Fixed transform URI so it works with windows paths
3/29/05: rng7: Network.py (setInitialVariableValue)
    Now updates the optimizableVarValues list
